# OpenLayers 3 - ERD Edition



Welcome to [OpenLayers 3](http://ol3js.org/) - ERD Edition! A fork of the [OpenLayers 3 Source](http://github.com/openlayers/ol3). 

The goal of this fork is to add features that ERD needs while maintaining code style and compatibility with the original OpenLayers 3 source. Features and functionality added here are free to be re-used in other projects or incorporated into ol3 source.

ERD (Emergency Response Division) is a child organization of the [http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about](Office of Response and Restoration) and subsequently the National Ocean Service and NOAA.
